# DeepSeek Task Delta

Use the canonical compact
[`TASK-CONTROLLER.md`](TASK-CONTROLLER.md) with
[`Workflow v2`](../docs/workflows/workflow-v2.md). Do not copy the full shared
governance contract into the prompt.

Add only these DeepSeek-specific instructions when they apply:

- start a fresh conversation for the bounded objective, normally one issue;
- begin from the observed symptom/outcome and expected behavior, not a presumed
  root cause;
- trace the real production path to the first confirmed mismatch;
- use applicable available read-only Core/QDN/SSH evidence;
- run `npm run verify` when the project defines it;
- leave required embedded Home or owner live validation pending until actually
  confirmed;
- allow one focused correction after a failed owner/live check, then escalate
  unexplained repetition or a high-risk boundary to ChatGPT/Codex;
- do not commit, push, publish, deploy, release, close issues, or perform live
  writes without exact owner authorization.

The task controller MUST state the repository, project context, one objective,
exit criterion, scope, verified starting evidence, task-specific constraints,
required validation, external-action authority, and canonical report path.
