# Qortium Development Knowledge Base

## Purpose

This directory is the operational knowledge base for AI-assisted Qortium
development. It supports new applications, existing-application audits,
issue-driven implementation, runtime diagnosis, QDN design, Home integration,
live validation, and releases.

## Use when

Start every substantial repository task with
[`00-SESSION-START.md`](00-SESSION-START.md). Use this README when reviewing the
guide architecture or its migration provenance.

## Do not use when

This README is not a task router and does not define a platform API. Do not load
every guide by default. Do not use removed Qortal material as current Qortium
guidance.

## Prerequisites

- Exact repository and local path.
- Current branch and working-tree state.

## Required inputs

- Owner request or GitHub issue.
- Current checked-out Qortium Home/Core sources when platform behavior matters.
- The matching project file, if one exists.

No original file is archived. Historical Qortal instructions have no active
operational value and would remain discoverable by agents if retained here.
Git history is the historical record.

## Mandatory rules

- Qortium Home and Core behavior MUST be verified from their current checked-out
  sources before implementation depends on it.
- Project-specific facts MUST stay under the root-level `projects/` directory.
- One task SHOULD normally implement one issue.
- Agents MUST NOT commit, push, tag, release, or publish without explicit owner
  authorization.
- Obsolete Qortal-to-Qortium porting MUST NOT be used as the default new-app
  workflow.

## Workflow

1. Enter through `00-SESSION-START.md`.
2. Classify the task.
3. Read the matching project file and only the routed domain guides.
4. Verify current authoritative sources.
5. Validate and report through the handoff guide.

## Validation

- Validate all relative Markdown links.
- Search this directory for obsolete active Qortal assumptions.
- Run repository formatting, lint, and `git diff --check`.
- Confirm generated output is not tracked.

## Completion criteria

This knowledge base is usable when an agent can begin either a brand-new
Qortium-native application or an audit of another existing application without
Discussion Boards context or Qortal bootstrap assumptions.
